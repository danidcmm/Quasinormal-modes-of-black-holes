# Quasinormal-modes-of-black-holes
This Mathematica notebook is aimed to the computation of quasinormal modes of non-singular black holes whose metric is Schwarzschild-like, i.e., those 
who have spherical symmetry. It has been done using the WKB method: In terms of the components of the metric, it is possible to compute the potential 
of the perturbations, the different corrections to each WKB orden and, therefore, the cuasinormal modes.
